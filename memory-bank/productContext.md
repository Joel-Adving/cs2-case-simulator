# Product Context: Counter-Strike 2 Case Unboxer

## Why This Project Exists

Counter-Strike 2 features a case opening system where players spend real money to open cases with a chance to receive weapon skins of varying rarity. However, the odds of receiving rare items are extremely low (as low as 0.26% for the rarest items), making it a potentially expensive gamble. This simulator allows players to experience the excitement of case openings without financial risk.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Financial Risk Mitigation**: Eliminates the real-money cost of CS2 case openings
2. **Probability Education**: Demonstrates the actual odds of receiving different rarities
3. **Entertainment Alternative**: Provides the entertainment value of case openings without expense
4. **Statistical Awareness**: Shows users their personal luck over many simulated openings
5. **Collection Visualization**: Lets users see what a collection might look like without investment

## How It Should Work

The application should:

-   Present users with a catalog of accurate CS2 cases
-   Allow selection and opening of cases with a visually faithful animation
-   Apply the exact probability distributions from the actual game
-   Calculate appropriate wear levels for skins (Factory New through Battle-Scarred)
-   Maintain a virtual inventory of opened items
-   Track statistics of openings for user awareness
-   Operate with minimal latency for a smooth user experience

## User Experience Goals

-   **Authenticity**: The opening experience should feel like the real game
-   **Satisfaction**: Users should enjoy the thrill of revealing items
-   **Education**: Users should gain understanding of the true odds
-   **Accessibility**: The interface should be intuitive and easy to use
-   **Performance**: The application should run smoothly on various devices
-   **Visual Appeal**: The design should match the quality of the CS2 interface
