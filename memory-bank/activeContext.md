# Active Context: Counter-Strike 2 Case Unboxer

## Current Work Focus: Ad Integration and Layout Optimization

The current focus is on understanding the full scope of the CS2 Case Unboxer project, which appears to be in a functional state with major features implemented. The codebase suggests an established application with both frontend and backend components working together to provide a case opening simulation experience.

## Recent Changes

Based on the file timestamps and code exploration:

-   Recent updates to statistical tracking (StatisticsController.cs - Mar 25)
-   Extensions added or modified (Mar 25)
-   Frontend UI improvements and component refinements (Mar 21)
-   Crate opening functionality enhancements (mid-March)
-   Database model adjustments (mid-March)

1. Implemented Google AdSense integration with responsive ad placements:

    - Top banner ad (mobile only)
    - Side skyscraper ads (desktop only)
    - Bottom banner ads
    - Fixed bottom ads

2. Created AdPlaceholder component with:

    - Multiple size variants (banner, square, leaderboard, mobile)
    - Responsive behavior
    - Testing controls for visibility and format
    - Tailwind-based styling for easier maintenance

3. Optimized ad layout:
    - Moved top banner inside main container for better mobile integration
    - Added side skyscraper ads (160x600) for desktop views
    - Ensured ads stretch full-width on mobile
    - Removed special background styling for seamless integration
    - Used Tailwind classes for responsive visibility (block md:hidden)

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Current Technical Decisions

-   The application uses the actual CS2 probability distribution for case openings
-   Case opening animations are customizable (normal or fast speed)
-   Sound effects can be toggled on/off
-   The system has real-time counters for total case openings

### Current Design Considerations

-   The UI follows CS2's aesthetic with appropriate colors for different rarity tiers
-   Mobile responsiveness is implemented with different layouts for various screen sizes
-   Focus on visual authenticity to match the real CS2 experience

## Next Steps

As this is an initial project assessment, potential next steps could include:

### Immediate Tasks

-   Complete full code review and understanding
-   Identify any current bugs or issues
-   Review test coverage and identify gaps
-   Assess performance optimizations

### Future Improvements

-   Add additional case types if missing
-   Implement additional statistics and visualizations
-   Enhance the user profile/inventory system
-   Explore offline functionality
-   Consider adding price trend data

## Open Questions

-   Is market pricing data updated automatically or manually?
-   What is the current test coverage for critical components?
-   Are there any performance bottlenecks in the current implementation?
-   Are there plans to add user accounts or persistence?

## Active Decisions

1. Mobile-first approach for ad placements
2. Different ad strategies for mobile vs desktop:
    - Mobile: Top banner + bottom ads
    - Desktop: Side skyscraper ads + bottom ads
3. Using standard AdSense sizes:
    - Banner (728x90)
    - Leaderboard (320x50)
    - Square (250x250)
    - Skyscraper (160x600)

## Technical Considerations

1. Using Tailwind for responsive design and styling
2. Maintaining proper spacing and layout across devices
3. Ensuring ads don't interfere with main content
4. Following Google AdSense guidelines for placement and spacing
