# Frontend Rules

## Folder Structure

- `frontend/assets/`: Static assets like images, fonts.
- `frontend/components/`: Reusable Vue components.
- `frontend/composables/`: Vue Composition API functions (hooks).
- `frontend/layouts/`: Layout components for pages.
- `frontend/pages/`: Page components mapped to routes.
- `frontend/public/`: Static files served at the root.
- `frontend/server/`: Server-side API routes and middleware (Nuxt specific).
- `frontend/services/`: API client logic.
- `frontend/tests/`: Unit and integration tests.
- `frontend/types/`: TypeScript type definitions.
- `frontend/utils/`: Utility functions.

## Vue Component Structure

Always structure `.vue` files as follows:

1.  `<script setup lang="ts">` at the top.
2.  `<template>` in the middle.
3.  `<style>` at the bottom.

## Coding Guidelines

- Utilize Nuxt 3's features, including the Composition API via `<script setup>`.
- Write code in TypeScript for type safety.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling components and layouts.
